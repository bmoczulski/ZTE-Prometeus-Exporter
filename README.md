# ZTE-MC801A-Prometeus-Exporter

This repository contains a Python script and necessary files to build a container image for exporting ZTE MC801A HyperBox 5G router metrics to Prometheus. The exporter fetches data from the router's web interface, converts it into Prometheus metrics, and exposes them through an HTTP server for scraping.
